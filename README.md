# Solutions to the Rust Programming Language Book

In this repo you will find my solutions to the practice exercises found at the end of
each chapter in the book. I hope they are helpful for anyone interested in learning Rust.

Feel free to propose different ways to solve the exercises or ways in which they can become
more efficient.

You can contact me at delamdev@proton.me if you have any doubts or comments.
